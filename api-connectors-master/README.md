BitMEX API Connectors
=====================

A few simple connectors for connecting to the BitMEX API, which conforms to the
[Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) spec.

Connectors in the `clients` directory are autogenerated. Connectors in the `official-*` directory
are written or vetted by BitMEX employees to showcase various features.

> The easiest way to get real-time data from BitMEX is via the

HTTP server that subscribes to live data on your behalf.
You can poll this local server as often as you want.
